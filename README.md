# Analyzing Industry Carbon Emissions
An small SQL query for a [DataCamp project](https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/1590) analysing industry carbon emissions from a [nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9) using PostgreSQL and T-SQL as well as vibe coding to achieve the needed result

> This data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, product_emissions, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production that these emissions occurred. ~DataCamp

We needed to see the type of industry (industry_group) and the number of unique companies in those each industries (num_companies) and their industrial footprint (total_industry_footprint) throughout the year of 2017 which was the last year in that database

A .csv file and 3 queries in a .txt file were provided to solve this problem, the first one is compatible with both T-SQL and PostgreSQL, the second one is compatible with PostgreSQL only, the third one is compatible with T-SQL only
